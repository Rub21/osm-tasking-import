# osm-tasking-import

We created this app as a preparations for the OSMGeoWeek. Our idea is import Peru school opendata into OpenStreetMap, but without  a handler data tool  it would be difficult and messy.

This app works similar to [tasking manager](https://github.com/hotosm/osm-tasking-manager2), the differences is that  you can setup each block to an url of data and download into JOSM to evaluate the data there, each block should have: `progress`, `done` and `validated` stage as the progress import is going. 

## How to prepare the data for this app?
